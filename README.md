# AutoGPTAWS

Welcome to **AutoGPTAWS** – an automated, intelligent development assistant that transforms your natural language ideas into working Python code ready to be deployed on AWS. Imagine a world where you simply describe what you want to build, and an AI-powered engine creates, tests, and even executes your code in a secure, self-contained environment.


## Overview

**AutoGPTAWS** empowers developers, technical enthusiasts, and startup founders to innovate faster by eliminating repetitive coding tasks. With our platform, you describe your problem or desired feature in plain English (for example, "create a function that returns the sum of two numbers"), and our AI reasoning engine:

- **Analyzes your prompt** and generates a development plan
- **Produces the corresponding Python code**
- **Executes and tests the code** in an isolated sandbox
- **Prepares the code** for deployment on AWS (with future integrations planned)

The only artifact moving between environments is the generated code, ensuring top-notch security while paving the way for seamless cloud deployments.


## Key Features

- **Natural Language Input:**  
  Describe your idea in everyday language—no extensive coding experience required.

- **Intelligent Code Generation:**  
  Leverage GPT-powered models (starting with AWS native services and configurable via our `config.yaml`) to convert your descriptions into clean, functional Python code.

- **Secure Sandbox Testing:**  
  Execute your generated code in a Docker-based, isolated environment that runs unit tests (for instance, verifying that `add(2, 3)` returns `5`) before any further actions are taken.

- **Configurable and Extensible:**  
  Use a simple configuration file to specify which AWS AI models and services to target. Experimentation is encouraged—modify the config as needed without changing the core code.

- **Agile and Iterative Development:**  
  Start with simple functions and gradually expand the platform’s capabilities. Our long-term vision includes a full-featured UI, automated deployment pipelines, and a self-improving feedback loop.


## Roadmap

Our journey with **AutoGPTAWS** begins small and agile:

1. **MVP Focus:**  
   - Start with a basic natural language prompt that creates a simple Python function (like an `add()` function).
   - Build a secure, self-contained environment for generating and testing code.

2. **Iterative Enhancements:**  
   - Expand to support more complex code generation and testing scenarios.
   - Integrate additional AWS AI services as configurable options.
   - Gradually add a robust web interface and collaboration tools.

3. **Future Vision:**  
   - Develop a platform that not only builds your projects from your prompts but also uses its own capabilities to iterate on its design—accelerating innovation and enabling self-improvement.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Docker** (for sandbox testing)
- An **AWS account** (for future integration; initial versions will use AWS native services as specified in our config)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ejochens/AutoGPTAWS.git
   cd AutoGPTAWS
   ```
2. **Review the Configuration:** The project includes a config.yaml file that defines:
    - AWS region and deployment settings
    - Default AWS AI services (using cost-effective, built-in models)
You can modify this file later to experiment with different models.
3. **Run the MVP Interface:** Start our minimal interface (command-line or a basic Flask web app) to enter your natural language prompt:
```python
python run.py
```
For example, input:

"Create a function that returns the sum of two numbers."

The system will generate the corresponding Python code and display it for your review.
4. **Sandbox Testing:** The platform automatically runs unit tests in a Docker-based sandbox (e.g., verifying that add(2, 3) == 5). Test results will be displayed in the interface.

5. **Next Steps:** Explore the code, review our documentation, and start contributing ideas for new features or improvements.
